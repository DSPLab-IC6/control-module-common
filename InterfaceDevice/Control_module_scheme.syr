INFO:Xst:1608 - Relative priorities of control signals on register <tx_buffer> differ from those commonly found in the selected device family. This will result in additional logic around the register.
WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 8-bit latch for signal <rx_data>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
WARNING:Xst:736 - Found 1-bit latch for signal <Mtrien_miso> created at line 65. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.

Final Macro Processing ...

Processing Unit <Control_module_scheme> :
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 6-bit shift register was found for signal <CD_SPI_slave/tx_buffer_7> and currently occupies 6 logic cells (3 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL16 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
